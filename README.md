   ##                Project-on-Advanced-Data-Analytics :
Exploratory Data Analysis on product/brand comparison for E-Commerce website.

* I gathered data from 2 E-Commerce websites, then applied EDA process and cleaned the data. I documented it in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and its libraries.

### üöÄ This project includes the process of data analysis such as :
* Data Collection using web scraping
* Data Cleansing
* Finding Missing data
* Error analysis
* Data Transformation
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics

üìó Python libraries :
  + NumPy  - package for scientific computing with Python
  + Pandas - fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool
     - To extract and analyze insights from datasets.
 
üìó Data Visualization libraries :
  + Matplotlib - a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
    - for designing plot and graphs.
  + Seaborn - statistical data visualization 
            - to improve the style of plots/graphs.

‚úîÔ∏è Used pandas for data manipulation; Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

üìò Web Scraping :
Web Scraping is a process of extracting data from a website. And, we use this method to collect data by scraping the HTML code from the particular website.

#### Data Cleansing :
Data Cleansing is the process of analyzing data for finding incorrect, corrupt, and missing values and abluting it to make it suitable for input to data analytics and various machine learning algorithms.

#### Data transformation :
Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format to another. The most common data transformations are converting raw data into a clean and usable form, converting data types and removing duplicate data. During the process of data transformation, an analyst will determine the structure, perform data mapping, extract the data from the original source, execute the transformation, and finally store the data in an appropriate database. 
* Transformed data is usable, accessible, and secure to benefit a variety of purposes.

#### Data wrangling :
Data wrangling is a term often used to describe the early stages of the data analytics process. It involves transforming and mapping data from one format into another.

#### Data visualizations :
Data visualizations are used to discover unknown facts and trends. It convert large and small data sets into visuals, which is easy to understand and process for humans.
+ the representation of information in the form of a chart, diagram, picture, etc. It can also be used as a reporting tool.

#### Inferential Statistics :
Inferential statistics is one of the two statistical methods employed to analyze data, along with descriptive statistics. The goal of this tool is to provide measurements that can describe the overall population of a research project by studying a smaller sample of it.

#### üîë Software Requirement :
       Jupyter Notebook(Anaconda)
