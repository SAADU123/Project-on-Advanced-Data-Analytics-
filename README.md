   ##                Project-on-Advanced-Data-Analytics :
Exploratory Data Analysis on product/brand comparison for E-Commerce website.

* I gathered data from 2 E-Commerce websites, then applied EDA process and cleaned the data. I documented it in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and its libraries.

### üöÄ This project includes the process of data analysis such as :
* Data Collection using web scraping
* Data Cleansing
* Finding Missing data
* Error analysis
* Data Transformation
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics

üìó Python libraries :
  + NumPy  - package for scientific computing with Python
  + Pandas - fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool
     - To extract and analyze insights from datasets.
üìó Data Visualization libraries :
  + Matplotlib - a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
    - for designing plot and graphs.
  + Seaborn - statistical data visualization 
            - to improve the style of plots/graphs.
* Used pandas for data manipulation; Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

#### Web Scraping :
Web Scraping is a process of extracting data from a website. And, we use this method to collect data by scraping the HTML code from the particular website.

#### Inferential Statistics :
Inferential statistics is one of the two statistical methods employed to analyze data, along with descriptive statistics. The goal of this tool is to provide measurements that can describe the overall population of a research project by studying a smaller sample of it.

#### üîë Software Requirement :
      * Jupyter Notebook(Anaconda)
